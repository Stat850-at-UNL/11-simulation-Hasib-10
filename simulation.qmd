## Question. 
What is the probability of winning a game of craps if the first roll is not a win (7 or 11) or a loss (2, 3, or 12)?

## R Code implimentation
The solution involves simulating a large number of games where the first roll establishes a "point" and then calculating the proportion of these games that are won.
```{r}
simulate_craps_game <- function() {
  roll_dice <- function() sum(sample(1:6, 2, replace = TRUE))
  first_roll <- roll_dice()
  if (first_roll %in% c(7, 11)) return(list(outcome = "win", point = NA))
  if (first_roll %in% c(2, 3, 12)) return(list(outcome = "lose", point = NA))
  point <- first_roll
  repeat {
    roll <- roll_dice()
    if (roll == point) return(list(outcome = "win", point = point))
    if (roll == 7) return(list(outcome = "lose", point = point))
  }
}

calculate_point_win_probability <- function(n_simulations = 100) {
  results <- replicate(n_simulations, simulate_craps_game(), simplify = FALSE)
    games_with_point <- sapply(results, function(x) !is.na(x$point))
  filtered_results <- results[games_with_point]
  wins <- sum(sapply(filtered_results, function(x) x$outcome == "win"))
  total <- length(filtered_results)
  
  probability <- wins / total
  return(probability)
}

set.seed(880)  
(point_win_probability <- calculate_point_win_probability(1000))

```
